Time complexity is O(n*m), where n is quantity of elements in array, and m is average length of each element.
Firstly, shortest element is identified. It helps avoid unecessary iterations as shortest word in array is the longest possible prefix.
Second step is creating nested loop that iterates through each character of each element of array and compares them. If characters match, they are added to stringbuilder as a common prefix, and iterations continue.
