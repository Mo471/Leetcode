Problem has both O(n^2) bruteforce solution, as well as sliding window O(n) solution.

For sliding window, we take pointer l and r on index 0, and move pointer r adding elements to int size and to map to see, when we find repeating one.
After getting to repeating one, we move l to the right as well, removing non-repeating characters from map and from size. If we get to repeating character, we move both l and r forward, and now we keep sliding window out of repeating characters.

Make sure to stop sliding window, if you get maximum of possible elements. In this problem it is 128 becase "consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces".
