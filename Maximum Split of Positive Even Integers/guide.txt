Time complexity is O(n), memory complexity O(1).
This algorithm will start only if given number is even.
Value `even` starting from 2 used in order to calculate unique even positive numbers, that can give in sum provided number.
On each iteration, just like in stack, even will be added to list and finalNum - even. Then even iterates by 2. After that, last element will be `popped`, and procedure will repeat itself, until finalNum - even <= even. At this point last valid list is an answer.
For instance, final num is 28. 
[2,28-2=26]
[2,4,22]
[2,4,6,16] // result
[2,4,6,8,8]// INVALID, previous valid list is result
