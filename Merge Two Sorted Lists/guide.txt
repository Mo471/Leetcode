Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of longest list. Memory complexity O(1).
New node is created to point to elements from original lists. Also, another node is created to point to the head of new node and to return final result.
Two pointers used to traverse through 2 given lists and take elements in ascending order from them to the new list.
When one of the lists is empty, remainder of the second list "attached" to the new list, and head of the final list is returned.
