Time complexity is O(n), memory complexity O(h) as recursive calls will be stored in stack with the max length of tree height.
Problem can be solved with stack and loop (in-order traversal) or with recursion. Recursive solution is provided.
In BST for this problem, left subtree of the node should contain only values < than node value, and right subtree should contain only values > than node value. For this problem we will use >= and <= due to inclusivity of given range.
That means that each node will have an allowed interval for its value, i.e. left border <= node.val <= right border. Each node value in allowed range is summarised into final sum, then it is returned.
